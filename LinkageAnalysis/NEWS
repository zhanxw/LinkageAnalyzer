0.8.7
* refactor codes from R to C++
0.8.6
* output version and date/time in single_parse()
0.8.5
* improve speed for double_lethal(), a major speed bottleneck
0.8.4
* add 'transform.pheno = "log"' for single_link() and double_link()
0.8.3
* Fix crashing when analyzing R0511 G1 pedigree (Tao's suggestion)
0.8.2
* Avoid crash when G2dam file has only three column
0.8.1
* Avoid crash when G2dam file has full columns of NA
* when G2 mother is VAR, do not crash on double link
0.8
* The function to parse multiple runs of single_link is provided (single_parse)
0.7.6
* Modified the plotting function in double_link
0.7.5
* A critical bug is fixed for calculating the probability of producing HET,VAR; VAR,HET; VAR,VAR mice
0.7.4
* A bug is cleared when the chromosome and genomoic locations are in random order rather than ascending order
0.7.3
* Bug fix for 0.7.2
0.7.2
* A minor addition to the code so that if certain G2 mother's genotype is unknown but at least one of its child is VAR, the mother is deemed HET
0.7.1
* Lethality tests have been reversed back to the Monte Carlo approach due to the problem of long run time
0.7
* Exact tests were applied to test for lethality in both single_link and double_link
0.6.5
* double_link now looks at the probability of VAR,HET; HET,VAR; and VAR,VAR for synthetic lethality test
0.6.4
* Added the test for synthetic lethality
* Added a new mode to test for inhibitory effect of two genes in double_link
0.6.3
* Modified the distribution plots for both single_link and double_link
* Genes with all "FALSE" genotypes are now completely removed from the plot and also from the Bonferroni calculation.
* Bonferroni correction is applied for double_link
0.6.2
* G2 mother with VAR will cause a warning instead of an error
* Fixed a bug that happens when only one mother has been genotyped
0.6
* Cleared a minor bug in double_link
0.5.3
* Equal variance is required when detecting multiple modes in phenotype scores to avoid unreasonable assignment of G3 mice
0.5.2
* If the genders of all G3 mice are the same, the gender variable is automatically deleted from statistical testing
0.5.1
* Penetrance and semidomiance are now attached in the analysis results from single_link
* The method to calculate lethal gene p values has been updated
0.5
* The function to test combinatory effect is complete now
* An option is added to test deviation from both directions (tail="both")
* An option is added to automatically detect possible clustering of phenotype scores and transform continuous variables to binary variables (detect=c("always","auto","never"))
0.4.2
* Added an option to control which direction from control to test for antibody reaction.
* Added an option to create personalized names for each job.
0.4
* Added the function to test combinatory effect of two mutations.
0.3
* The fixed effect model no longer considers G2 mother effect. 
0.2
* Added a vignette
* Added a log file as output 
* Added scattorplots of phenotypes (continous) and table plots of phenotypes (binary) in an output pdf file
* Replaced the specification of output file names with one output folder to contain all the file
* Sex is now treated as 0 or 1 (numerical), with missing values equal to 0.5
