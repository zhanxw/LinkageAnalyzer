#' @title Parse the analysis results of multiple runs of single.link
#'
#' @description
#' This function loads the RData file under each folder for one
#' \code{single.link} analysis event and make a summary of the analysis results
#' for multiple runs. WARNING: under each folder specified by \code{runs}, there
#' can only be the output files of one run of \code{single.link}!
#'
#' @param dir The main directory where there are at least one sub-folder which
#' contain(s) the analysis results of \code{single.link}
#' @param runs A vector of character strings. The sub-folder name(s) directly
#' under \code{dir} containing the analysis results of \code{single.link} that
#' should be pooled and parsed. WARNING: under each folder specified by
#' \code{runs}, there can only be the output files of one run of
#' \code{single.link}!
#' @param output The output folder to put the summarized output
#' @param prefix Default is "". An optional character string to be attached to
#' output file names. This can create personalized names for each job.
#' @param silent Print intermediate messages to stdout if set to FALSE.
#' @details The analysis output from multiple runs of \code{single.link} will be
#' parsed and summarized into a .csv file to be put under \code{output}. A .txt
#' log file will also be generated.
#' @return No return value.
